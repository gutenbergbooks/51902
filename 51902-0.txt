        Essays & Letters of MONTAIGNE.

       Edited by WILLIAM CAREW HAZLITT.
           _NEW AND ENLARGED INDEX_

AN ENTIRELY NEW EDITION formed from a Collation of the Foreign
Quotations; a fresh English rendering and a careful revision of the
text throughout. Some account of the Life of Montaigne, Notes to which
are added, a Translation of all the Letters known to be extant.


MR. HAZLITT'S MONTAIGNE,--An entirely new Edition text of Montaigne's
Essays and Letters (founded on the now extremely scarce one published
in 1877 in three volumes octavo) has now been brought to completion
(Publisher, Messrs. Reeves and Turner) and will, partly by reason of
enlarged introductory matter and partly by additional notes, extend to
four volumes. The Edition of 1877 was superintended by Mr. Hazlitt's
father, though bearing his own name on the title, and he merely
contributed the Preface. The book has now at length been adapted to
the last French /Variorum/ so far as possible, and innumerable errors
of the former English versions have been rectified. The Biographical
account of the essayist has been considerably amplified and =instead
of the sixteen Letters= given in 1877 =there are thirty-five=, many of
which are of interest and importance towards understanding the Life of
the Author. A salient feature in the present undertaking is to have
substituted for the English colloquial equivalents, or rather supposed
equivalents of the great Frenchman's language, the words which he
actually uses or the sense, which he actually intends to convey; and
the difference is often curious and sometimes immense between him and
his English renderers.--/The Athenæum./

         CHOPIN: THE MAN AND HIS MUSIC.

               BY JAMES HUNEKER,
    Author of "Mezzotints in Modern Music."

"Mr Huneker is a Chopin enthusiast. He accords admiration to Brahms,
to Wagner, to Tchaïkovsky: his worship is reserved for Chopin. Being
gifted with clear insight and imagination which grasp many and diverse
moods Mr. Huneker is a sane critic and a manly.... There is no
pretence at new material in the book. Mr. Huneker has garnered all
that has been written about the composer and he has threshed out the
grain from the chaff. The result is, therefore, of value."--/Musical
Standard./

Cobbett's "Rural Rides" is to us a delightful book, but it is one
